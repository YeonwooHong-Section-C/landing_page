 # Design choice
- To create a clear and minimalist aesthetic, I utilized monochromatic colors throughout except for Humber's main color, which is featured exclusively on the hero section's button.
- Employing a relatively smaller font size on the header side adds a touch of modernity.
- While the overall impression remains modest, I gave a small element of amusement by adding a shake event on the repository links.
